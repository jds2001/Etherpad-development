Installation instructions:

* Install the dependencies: Scala 2.7, a JDK that supports Java 1.6,
  and libmysql-java

* Sun Java 6 and OpenJDK 1.6 are known to work.

* Note that Scala 2.8 is currently known NOT to work

* Uninstall gcj if it's installed as it seems to interfere with the
  Scala compiler. You can safely reinstall it after compiling Etherpad
  if you want to.

* Edit the files bin/build.sh and bin/run.sh (and optionally
  bin/etherpad.init.d) and change the paths to match your system.

* Run bin/build.sh

* Create a new user on your system called "etherpad"

* Create a MySQL database "etherpad" and a database user "etherpad"

* Copy etherpad/etc/etherpad.localdev-default.properties to etherpad/etc/etherpad.local.properties

* Edit etherpad/etc/etherpad.local.properties and set
   etherpad.SQL_JDBC_URL
       Example etherpad.SQL_JDBC_URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/etherpad
   etherpad.SQL_PASSWORD
   etherpad.SQL_USERNAME = etherpad
   etherpad.adminPass
   topdomains
       Example: topdomains = yourhostname.com,localhost

* Create a link to bin/etherpad.init.d from /etc/init.d/etherpad

* Run /etc/init.d/etherpad start
